		I'm an M.S. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/"><u>Georgia Institute of Technology</u></a>. I received my B.Tech. in Information Technology from <a href="https://ceg.annauniv.edu/"><u>College of Engineering,Guindy</u></a> in 2016.
		<br /><br />
		My primary research interests include artificial intelligence and machine learning as applied to creative media, including image and video processing and natural language understanding. I am also interested in how AI, data science, and computing can be used for social good.
		<br /><br />
		Previously I spent 3 years at <a href="https://www.adobe.com/"><u>Adobe</u></a>, developing ML infrastructure for data scientists as well as providing machine learning based solutions as API services for different problems across the company.

		In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running and taking photos. Lately, I've also been obsessed with my iPad, solving crosswords, doodling on Amaziograph and exploring generative artistry!
