			I'm a 2nd year Masters student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. I received my B.Tech. in Information Technology from <a href="https://ceg.annauniv.edu/">College of Engineering,Guindy</a> in 2016.
			<br /><br />
			My research interests lie in making deep learning models more fair and explainable, and tasks that could benefit from improved model interepretability. I am also very interested in learning under semi-supervised and unsupervised settings.
			<br /><br />
			Previously I spent 3 years at <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>, developing ML infrastructure for data scientists as well as providing machine learning based solutions as API services for different problems across the company.

			In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running and chasing sunsets. Lately, I've also spent a lot of my time solving the New York Times crossword and playing online chess!
