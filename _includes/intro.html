		I'm an M.S. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. I received my B.Tech. in Information Technology from <a href="https://ceg.annauniv.edu/">College of Engineering,Guindy</a> in 2016.
		<br /><br />
		My primary research interests include artificial intelligence and machine learning at the intersection of image processing and natural language understanding. I am also interested in how we can leverage AI and data science, to address social and environmental challenges in our society.
		<br /><br />
		Previously I spent 3 years at <a href="https://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>, developing ML infrastructure for data scientists as well as providing machine learning based solutions as API services for different problems across the company.

		In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running and chasing sunsets. Lately, I've also spent a lot of my time solving the New York Times crossword, doodling on <a href="http://www.amaziograph.com/">Amaziograph</a> and exploring generative art!
