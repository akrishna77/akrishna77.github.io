## Grayscale Video Colorization
Built a system that automatically colorizes grayscale videos and historical films, in an effort to restore videos to their original colors.

## [Deep Reinforcement Learning to Mastermind Settlers of Catan](https://akrishna77.github.io/projects/QSettlers/)
Developed an agent to play the game, Settlers of Catan in its entirety, using a Deep Q-Network agent that can utilize gameplay mechanics and outperform both current state-of-the-art agents and humans.

## [Visual Relationship Detection](https://akrishna77.github.io/projects/visual-relationships/)
Proposed a few-shot learning based approach to detect objects of interest in an image, given a specific predicate relationship that has been highlighted through text input.

## [Visual Essence](https://akrishna77.github.io/projects/CS8903-Essence/)
Working on vision research in the creative AI space under [Dr. Devi Parikh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh), focusing on obtaining a visual representation that adequately conveys the essence of a person's description of themselves.

## Information Retrieval across Indic Scripts
Developed an Indic script web search engine (Hindi, Tamil, English) that involved querying and retrieving results in more than one language. Proposed a new ranking algorithm based on query intent by applying classification and heuristics on multilingual queries.
The algorithm is capable of term matching and language identification, overcoming complications like spelling variation. 
Performed a comparative analysis of the query intention classifier, concluding that Naive Bayes had higher accuracy than J48 in terms of recall and F1 score. This project was submitted and accepted as my undergraduate thesis under the advise of [Dr. Ranjani Parthasarathi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SMhTwtYAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Answer Me
Implemented a web service that provides answers to questions on an exercise sheet. It initially uses OCR to retrieve the text from the scanned image of the sheet and then uses a web search API to obtain the most relevant answers.
