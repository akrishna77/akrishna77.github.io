- #### [Multihop Question Answering](https://akrishna77.github.io/multihop-qa/)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Reproduced experiments for two published papers, DecompRC and Graph-based Recurrent Retriever and verified their validity and conclusions for the task of multihop question answering. Experimented by combining the merits of the two models to develop and evaluate an alternative approach to solving the same task and presented our results on the HotpotQA dataset. </span>

- #### [Grayscale Video Colorization](https://tinyurl.com/rb2q6ex)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Built a system that automatically colorizes grayscale videos and historical films, in an effort to restore videos to their original colors. </span>

- #### [Deep Reinforcement Learning to Mastermind Settlers of Catan](https://akrishna77.github.io/QSettlers/)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Developed an agent to play the game, Settlers of Catan in its entirety, using a Deep Q-Network agent that can utilize gameplay mechanics and outperform both current state-of-the-art agents and humans. </span>

- #### [Visual Relationship Detection](https://akrishna77.github.io/visual-relationships/)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Proposed a few-shot learning based approach to detect objects of interest in an image, given a specific predicate relationship that has been highlighted through text input. </span>

- #### [Visual Essence](https://akrishna77.github.io/CS8903-Essence/)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Working on vision research in the creative AI space under [Dr. Devi Parikh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh), focusing on obtaining a visual representation that adequately conveys the essence of a person's description of themselves. </span>

- #### [Bias Discovery](https://akrishna77.github.io/#/)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Working on vision research in the algorithmic fairness space under [Dr. Judy Hoffman](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~judy), focusing on detecting potentially unfair model biases via unsupervised discovery of dataset subpopulations with varying performance. </span>

- #### [Information Retrieval across Indic Scripts](https://tinyurl.com/umyhpsr)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Developed an Indic script web search engine (Hindi, Tamil, English) that involved querying and retrieving results in more than one language. Proposed a new ranking algorithm based on query intent by applying classification and heuristics on multilingual queries. This project was submitted and accepted as my undergraduate thesis under the advise of [Dr. Ranjani Parthasarathi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SMhTwtYAAAAJ&hl=en). </span>

<!-- - #### AnswerMe
Implemented a web service that provides answers to questions on an exercise sheet. It initially uses OCR to retrieve the text from the scanned image of the sheet and then uses a web search API to obtain the most relevant answers. -->
