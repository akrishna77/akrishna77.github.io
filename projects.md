- #### [Deep Reinforcement Learning to Mastermind Settlers of Catan](https://akrishna77.github.io/QSettlers/)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Developed an agent to play the game, Settlers of Catan in its entirety, using a Deep Q-Network agent that can utilize gameplay mechanics and outperform both current state-of-the-art agents and humans. </span>

- #### [Visual Relationship Detection](https://akrishna77.github.io/visual-relationships/)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Proposed a few-shot learning based approach to detect objects of interest in an image, given a specific predicate relationship that has been highlighted through text input. </span>

- #### [Visual Essence](https://akrishna77.github.io/CS8903-Essence/)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Working on vision research in the creative AI space under [Dr. Devi Parikh](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh), focusing on obtaining a visual representation that adequately conveys the essence of a person's description of themselves. </span>

- #### [Information Retrieval across Indic Scripts](https://tinyurl.com/umyhpsr)
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Developed an Indic script web search engine (Hindi, Tamil, English) that involved querying and retrieving results in more than one language. Proposed a new ranking algorithm based on query intent by applying classification and heuristics on multilingual queries. This project was submitted and accepted as my undergraduate thesis under the advise of [Dr. Ranjani Parthasarathi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=SMhTwtYAAAAJ&hl=en). </span>

<!-- - #### AnswerMe
Implemented a web service that provides answers to questions on an exercise sheet. It initially uses OCR to retrieve the text from the scanned image of the sheet and then uses a web search API to obtain the most relevant answers. -->
